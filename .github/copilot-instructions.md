# About me
I am a machine learning engineer and data scientist building generative AI applications. I use Python as my primary language and Streamlit for creating interactive web interfaces for our ML models.

# About my codebase
Frontend: Streamlit for interactive UI components and data visualization
Backend: Python with FastAPI for any necessary API endpoints
ML Framework: PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, and scikit-learn
Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy, and specialized ML preprocessing libraries
Testing: pytest for unit and integration tests
CI/CD: GitHub Actions

# Preferences
Always suggest Python solutions with type hints
Follow SOLID principles in all code suggestions:
Single Responsibility Principle: Each class/function should have only one reason to change
Open/Closed Principle: Open for extension, closed for modification
Liskov Substitution Principle: Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes
Interface Segregation Principle: No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use
Dependency Inversion Principle: Depend on abstractions, not concretions
Structure Streamlit apps with clear separation of concerns:
Data loading/processing functions
Model inference functions
UI rendering functions
Include docstrings in Google or NumPy format for all functions and classes
Implement proper error handling, especially for model inference and data processing
Prefer functional programming patterns when appropriate
Suggest efficient code that works well with large datasets or complex models
Include unit tests when suggesting new components or functions
Use environment variables for configuration and secrets management
Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
Organize code into modular components that can be easily maintained and extended
Provide clear comments for complex algorithms or ML-specific implementations

# ML/AI Specific Guidelines
Suggest proper model checkpointing and experiment tracking
Include data validation steps before processing
Implement appropriate evaluation metrics for ML models
Consider memory usage and performance optimization for large models
Suggest appropriate caching strategies for Streamlit apps with compute-intensive operations
Include proper logging for model training and inference
Consider ethical implications when implementing generative AI features
